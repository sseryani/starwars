To run: cd into directory, npm install, npm start.

Lessons Learned:
    - I would have used React Router having known what I know now. I feel like I overcomplicated the navigation.
    - The website has a 90's vanilla HTML feel. Definitely use some professional library like Bootstrap next time. 
    - Caching improves performance and usability but comes with a few problems.
